#What is it?
Listman is a simple web server built on the Google Cloud Platform App Engine which manages infinitely recursive list. This is a simple front end built in ReactJS using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
